                <p class="auther__subtitle col-12">Bhagvad Gita was written more than 5000 years ago, and is an integral part of the epic Mahabharata. However, because of its relevance towards leading a holistic life, it has gained prominence over Mahabharata itself. </p>
                <div class="auther__cards justify-content-center row m-0">
                    <div class="auther__card col-xl-4 col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-6 pt-5">
                        <p class="auther__description">Unlike spiritual books, which recommend world of renunciation and adoption of life of austerity and penance, Bhagavad Gita helps understand how one can enrich his/her life by excelling in the field of his/her aptitude.</p>
                        <p class="auther__description">It is about a holistic view to life that leads to happiness through practice of sequential and logical methods. Pursuit to Happiness, needs to convert knowledge into intellect, which is prescribed in this great discourse. Bhagavad Gita is like an Ocean filled with priceless jewels.</p>
                        <p class="auther__description">The more one dives deep into it, the more jewels one is bound to discover. In corporate world, organizations are facing challenges with regard to Ownership, Leadership, Communication, Values, Negotiation, Productivity, Relationship, Gap between Skill and Talent etc.</p>

                    <div class="auther__card col-xl-4 col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-6 pt-5">
                        <p class="auther__description">Bhagavad Gita has a solution to all the above challenges, provided one engages (works as prescribed). This book is towards unveiling and understanding the eighteenth chapter of Bhagavad Gita which happens to be a summary of the first seventeen chapters.</p>
                        <p class="auther__description">This not only summarizes but elaborates some points, which are hinted at, in earlier chapters. Therefore, if someone reads or understands this chapter, he/she will be able to understand Bhagavad Gita in totality. The most important message that this book leaves you with is “WHAT MIND CAN CONCEIVE, MAN CAN ACHIEVE”.</p>
