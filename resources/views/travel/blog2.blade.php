                <p class="travel-details__description">In our journey of life, we frequently come across situations, which, at times, are not in line with our expectation. Many a times we claim that circumstances play some role, and some elements, beyond our perceived realm of control, are governing our life.</p>
                <p class="travel-details__description">When one passes through such phases of life and is looking for some structured guideline for conscious attempts towards inner awakening, he/she attempts to gain control in various aspect of life, and take required correction of the course, so that the journey of life cruises in the desired direction. This being the case you are at the right place. When you go through the timeless wisdom of Bhagavad Gita, you shall embark upon a journey, which shall magically transform your life.</p>

                <p class="travel-details__description">One of the prevailing myths, which is now becoming a validated truth - “What is there in Mahabharata is there in one’s life, and what is not there in Mahabharata is not there in one’s life!”  </p>
                <p class="travel-details__description">Even the Hindi word ‘Iti–hasa’ has one of the interpreted meanings –  ‘Iti’ (As) and ‘Hasa’ (Happened). Thus, Mahabharata is said to be that part of our Iti–hasa (As happened), which was narrated and scripted by Bhagwan Ved Vyasa. 
As part of this Iti–hasa the wisdom, which Lord Krishna had shared with Arjuna (Bhagavad Gita), had not only guided Arjuna to emerge victorious in the battle of Kurukshetra, but have become a guiding force and tool for all the Arjunas who want to emerge victorious from numerous battles being fought in one’s respective life.</p>

                <p class="travel-details__description">As in battlefield, and so in life, or so as well in the corporate world, winner is not necessarily the one who is the best, but the one who has the right kind of guideline, which helps him/her be consistent. Not only that, Bhagavad Gita is a manual for self, which shall become much required personalised and customized guideline to wage one’s wars in the battlefield of life.</p>
                <p class="travel-details__description">This form of ‘Gyan’ (Knowledge) shall help to align ‘Karma’ (Actions) to move towards ‘Uchit Disha’ (Right Direction) of Vijay (Victory).<br><br>
